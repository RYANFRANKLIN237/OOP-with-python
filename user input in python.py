name = input("enter your name: ")
print(f"your name is {name}")

##the above was for texts
## for numbers you have to convert string to a int because the input function returns a plain string
##to get an integer whole number you can do this below


#get input
x = int(input("enter x:"))
y = int(input("enter y:"))

sum = x + y
print(f"addition of {x} and {y} is {sum}")
